From the late 1990s, the Korean Wave, centered around dramas, became a craze in various Asian countries, and from the mid-to-late 2000s, Korean pop songs were loved all over the world, mainly in Asia, but also in Europe, South America, and the Middle East, leading to the Korean Drama Wave. The craze continued. Among the various genres of K-Pop, it can be said that the music of idol groups (girl groups & boy groups) has created a lot of buzz among young people around the world.

The characteristics of K-Pop idol music are simple and cheerful rhythms and beats, easy-to-sing melodies, interesting lyrics, and group dances with great dance skills. Another characteristic that is different from Western pop is that it provides great visual enjoyment. Idols who have been trained for a long period of time by music agencies mostly consist of 5 to 6 members, up to 10 or more, and they delight the eyes with their good looks, sensuous fashion style, and flashy dance and stage sets.

Promotion through online communities played a large part in the spread of K-Pop. Music agencies carried out online marketing by posting promotional music videos of their singers on YouTube, etc., and those who heard them spread them through SNS (social network services) such as Twitter and Facebook, rapidly spreading K-Pop to young people around the world.
